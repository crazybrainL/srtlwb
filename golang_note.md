# Golang

[Download the archive](https://golang.org/dl/) and extract it into /usr/local, creating a Go tree in /usr/local/go.
For example:
```sh
tar -C /usr/local -xzf go$VERSION.$OS-$ARCH.tar.gz
```

Add /usr/local/go/bin to the PATH environment variable. (~/.zshec has already setting)
```sh
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
```
