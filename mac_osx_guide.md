### Xcode

* Install [Xcode] from the App store or the Apple developer website.

```

## Package And Programming Language:
### [Homebrew]
#### Install

```sh
$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

#### What Does Homebrew Do?
Homebrew installs packages to their own directory and then symlinks their files into /usr/local.

#### Install Packages
1. cmake  
2. cscope 
3. ctags  
4. lua    
5. tree
    - This progeam can show the file list.
6. tmux
7. ...

```sh
$ brew install cmake cscope ctags lua tree tmux ...
```

After installing, you could

1. Use **tree** to make sure that brew install succeeds.
2. **cd** to /usr/local/bin and use **ls -l** to make sure that symbolic link is correct.
3. Use **which** to find out where a program is located.  

```sh
# Step 1.
$ tree /usr/local/Cellar -L 1 (layer one)
/usr/local/Cellar
├── ...
├── cmake
├── cscope
├── ctags
├── lua
├── tree
├── ...

# Step 2.
$ cd /usr/local/bin
$ ls -l
...
cmake -> ../Cellar/cmake/3.6.3/bin/cmake
cscope -> ../Cellar/cscope/15.8b/bin/cscope
ctags -> ../Cellar/ctags/5.8_1/bin/ctags
lua -> ../Cellar/lua/5.2.4_4/bin/lua
tree -> ../Cellar/tree/1.7.0/bin/tree
...

# Step 3.
$ which cmake cscope ctags lua tree
/usr/local/bin/cmake
/usr/local/bin/cscope
/usr/local/bin/ctags
/usr/local/bin/lua
/usr/local/bin/tree
```

### zsh
#### Install zsh
```sh
$ brew install zsh

# Change to new zsh (/usr/local/bin/zsh).
$ chsh -s /usr/local/bin/zsh
```

Check install succeeds
```sh
# Step 1.
$ tree /usr/local/Cellar -L 1 (layer one)
/usr/local/Cellar
├── ...
├── zsh
├── ...

# Step 2.
$ cd /usr/local/bin/
$ ls -l
zsh -> ../Cellar/zsh/5.2/bin/zsh

# Step 3.
$ which zsh
/usr/local/bin/zsh
```

#### Install oh-my-zsh
```sh
$ sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

If you want to install other path you can use git clone and remeber to change .zshrc setting.
```sh
$ git clone git://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh.git [your_path]
```

#### Install zsh-completions
Reference: [icarus4]
```sh
$ brew install zsh-completions  
```

Check install succeeds, you can use **ls** command to make sure that package install succeeds.
```sh
$ ls /usr/local/share
aclocal         doc             git-gui         info            systemtap       zsh-completions
autoconf        emacs           gitk            lua             vim
cmake           git-core        gitweb          man             zsh
```

#### Setup [zshrc]
```sh
$ cd ~/Documents/
$ git clone https://github.com/whlin/zshrc.git
$ cd ~/Documents/zshrc
$ ./install_unix.sh
```

### Golang

[Download the archive](https://golang.org/dl/) and extract it into /usr/local, creating a Go tree in /usr/local/go.
For example:
```sh
tar -C /usr/local -xzf go$VERSION.$OS-$ARCH.tar.gz
```

Add /usr/local/go/bin to the PATH environment variable. (~/.zshec has already setting)
```sh
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
```

### Python
#### Simple Python version management: [pyenv]

Install:
```sh
$ curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yyuu/pyenv-installer/master/bin/pyenv-installer | bash
```

Uninstall: pyenv is installed within $PYENV_ROOT (default: ~/.pyenv). To uninstall, just remove it:
```sh
$ rm -fr ~/.pyenv
```
and remove these three lines from .bashrc:
```
export PATH="~/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"
```

#### Install python using pyenv

List all versions of python
```sh
$ pyenv install --list
...
2.7.10
2.7.11
2.7.12
3.0.1
3.1
3.1.1
...
```

Install one of python versions
```sh
$ pyenv install 2.7.12
```
[Note] For this installation, it could also install pip for this python version. If not, you could install pip using easy_install.

```sh
$ easy_install pip
```

See python versions
```sh
$ pyenv versions
*  system
   2.7.12
```

Change python versions
```sh
$ pyenv global 2.7.12
   system
*  2.7.12
```

#### Install Python Package
Python Package manager
* pip
* easy_install

Example: Install pyflakes
```sh
$ pip install pyflakes
```

How to list all installed packages and their versions in Python?
```sh
$ pip freeze
```

#### Find out your python site-package path
```sh
$ python -c "import site; print('\n'.join(site.getsitepackages()))"
```

you can use pip show to see more information for your installed python package, Example: pyflakes
```sh
$ pip show pyflakes
Name: pyflakes
Version: 1.3.0
Summary: passive checker of Python programs
Home-page: https://github.com/pyflakes/pyflakes
Author: A lot of people
Author-email: code-quality@python.org
License: MIT
Location: /Users/whlin/.pyenv/versions/2.7.12/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages
Requires:
```

You need to figure out what is going on when using pyenv and pip install package to build your develop environment.
When you use pip and easy_install to install package, where is the package? 
* The pyenv project architecture.
* pip install package flow

### [Node]
#### Install Node
```sh
$ brew install node
```

#### What is npm?
npm makes it easy for JavaScript developers to share and reuse code, and it makes it easy to update the code that you're sharing.

#### what is ~/.npm dir for?
~/.npm is a cache that npm uses to avoid re-downloading the same package multiple times. There's no harm in removing it. You can empty it with the command:
```sh
npm cache clean
```


#### Installing npm packages locally or globally
There are two ways to install npm packages: locally or globally. You choose which kind of installation to use based on how you want to use the package.

If you want to depend on the package from your own module using something like Node.js' require, then you want to install locally, which is npm install's default behavior. 

On the other hand, if you want to use it as a command line tool, something like the grunt CLI, then you want to install it globally.


#### [Installing npm packages locally](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally)

A package can be downloaded with the command
```sh
$ npm install <package_name>
```
This will create the node_modules directory in your current directory(if one doesn't exist yet), and will download the package to that directory.

#### [Installing npm packages globally](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-globally)

To download packages globally, you simply use the command
```sh
$ npm install -g <package_name>
```
The package will be installed in the global package set: node_modules (Path: /usr/local/lib/node_modules)

### vim
#### Install vim
```sh
$ brew install vim --with-lua --with-python
```

#### Setup [vimfilers]
[Important] There are some vim plugin for python, golang and nodeJS use these command to install YouCompleteMe or other plugins so you have to finish python, golang and nodeJS installation first.

```sh
$ cd ~/Documents
$ git clone https://github.com/whlin/vimfilers.git
$ cd vimfiles
$ ./install_unix.sh
```

#### Install haskell
```sh
$ brew install haskell-platform
$ cabal install hasktags
$ cabal install hlint
```

### Virtualbox and Vagrant
#### Install
Download the install package(.dmg) through following links to install virtualbox and vagrant:
* virtualbox: <https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads>
* vagrant: <https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html>

#### Install Vagrant Plugin
* Reference: [vagrant-vbguest](https://github.com/dotless-de/vagrant-vbguest)

```sh
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
```

### Setup [rc]
```sh
$ cd ~/Documents
$ git clone https://github.com/whlin/rc.git
$ cd rc
$ ./install_unix.sh
```
